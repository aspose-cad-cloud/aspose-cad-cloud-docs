## **Aspose.CAD Cloud SDKs**
Aspose.CAD Cloud is a modern REST oriented API, that allows easy integration into existing systems.
### **Why use an SDK?**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project.
### **SDK benefits**
Our supported SDKs are 100% tested and out of the box running. These SDKs are open source and have an MIT license. You can use them, and even customize them for absolutely free of charge.
### **Versioning Support in SDKs**
[Aspose.CAD Cloud SDKs](https://github.com/aspose-cad-cloud) have "Version" property for API Configuration classes. The attribute allows targeting a specific version. Supported versions are:

- v1 (default) - updated on a monthly basis or more frequent
- v2 (stable) - updated once a quarter
- v3 (frozen) - previous version of "stable", updated once a quarter
