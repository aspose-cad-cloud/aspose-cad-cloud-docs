**Welcome to the Aspose.CAD Cloud documentation section**

Aspose.CAD Cloud allows developers to convert CAD drawings such as DWG, DWF and DXF to PDF and Raster images. It is a REST API so does not require AutoCAD or any software to be installed. You can also convert the selected layers and layouts from the CAD drawings. The conversion to PDF and Raster images is of very high quality. Using Aspose.CAD Cloud in your project gives you the following benefits:

- Rich set of features
- Platform independence
- Performance and scalability
- Minimal learning curve

### **Cloud SDKs**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-cad-cloud) for a complete list of Aspose.CAD SDKs along with working examples, to get you started in no time. Please check [Available SDKs](/available-sdks/) article to learn how to add an SDK to your project.
### **API Explorer**
[Aspose.CAD Cloud API Reference](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/cad/) is the easiest way to try out our APIs right away in your browser! It allows you to effortlessly interact and try out every single operation our APIs exposes.
### **Security and Authentication**
The Aspose.CAD Cloud APIs are secured and requires authentication. There are two ways to authenticate Aspose REST APIs:

1. OAuth 2.0
1. URL Signing

Please check [Authenticating API Requests](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/storagecloud/Authenticating+API+Requests) article for more details.
